Train was going from town to town. Unfortunately engine has failed.
There are cabs coming to move passengers to original destination.
We need to use as little cabs as possible.
Passengers don't want to be separated 
from other passengers with whom they rode in one compartment.
One compartment is for 4 passengers, the same as one taxi.

In:
In first line there is number n (1<=n<=10^5) of groups of passengers.
In next line there is array of numbers. 
Numbers of people in each compartment ai. (1<= ai <=4)
Out:
Smallest possible number of cabs we need to move all passengers.

Example:
In:
5
1 2 4 3 3
Out:
4

*We can send group number 3 in first taxi.
Group number 4 in second taxi.
Group number 5 in third taxi.
First and second group in last taxi.
