There is a given array with dimensions n x m. Elements of this array are natural numbers.
The path through the array we call string of coordinates of this array
(w0,0), (w1,1), ..., (wm-1,m-1).
Rules:
0<= wi <= n-1 for each i=0, ..., m-1
|wi- w(i-1)| <= 1 for each i=1, ...., m-1   

The cost of the path we will call sum of the numbers that are on the squares on the path.

Write a program that will find the path with the smallest cost. If there are many paths,
your program should write one of them.

In:
In the first line are two numbers n and m(dimensions of the array).
Respectively number of rows and number of columns.
Both smaller than 1000.
In the next lines - m*n elements of the array. (writen down in rows)
Out:
In line your program has to write out a string of numbers w0,w1, ... wm-1
which are the row coordinates of each element in the smallest cost path.

Example:
In:
4 3
2 3 1
2 1 6
5 0 4
1 4 5
Out:
0 1 0
