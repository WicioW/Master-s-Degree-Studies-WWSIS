There is a game. You put your pawn on the board on the square with number 0.
You have to throw a dice and move your pawn by the number you got. 
In all squares there are different numbers. If your pawn lands on some square
you have to add up this number to the numbers you got earlier in the same way.
The point of this game is to get the biggest number.

In:
In first line you get number n, number of squares on the board. (1 <= n <= 1 000 0000)
In the second line there are numbers on each square p0,p1, ... ,pn-1 (-1000 <= pi <= 1000)
Out:
Only one number with a sum of the biggest number you can get according to rules above.


Example:
In:
5
3 1 -2 -1 3
Out:
7
