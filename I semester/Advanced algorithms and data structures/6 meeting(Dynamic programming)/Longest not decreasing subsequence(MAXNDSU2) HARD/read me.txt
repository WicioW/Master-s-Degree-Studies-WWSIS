Similar to earlier task but harder. Much longer array.

Write a program that for given array of numbers a1,a2,...,an will print out 
lenght of not decreasing subsequence.

In:
In first line there is given length of the array n (1<=n<=10^6).
in second line there is n natural numbers a1,a2,...,an within a range[1<=...<=10^6]
Out:
Length of the longest not decreasing subsequence

Example:
10
5 3 2 5 4 2 1 9 100 90
Out:
4
