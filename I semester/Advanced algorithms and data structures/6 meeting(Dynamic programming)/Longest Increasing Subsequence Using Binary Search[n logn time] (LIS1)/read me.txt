Write a program that for a given array of numbers a1,a2,...an will print out the longest increasing
subsequence. Because program may find many subsequences fullfilling given task, it should 
additionally print out only the array that is smallest lexicographically.

In:
In first line there is given length n (1<=n<=10^6)
In second line there is n natural numbers a1,a2,...,an (1<=...<=10^6)
Out:
Length of the longest increasing subsequence.
Smallest lexicographically subsequence.

Example:
In:
13
16 5 8 6 1 10 5 2 15 3 2 4 1
Out:
4
1 2 3 4
