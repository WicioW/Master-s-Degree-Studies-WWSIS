Pero is a passionate lover of riddles. The newest type of riddles
he has come across requires the solver to check whether the given 
word is a multigram . A multigram is a word that consists of concatenating 
two or more words that are all mutually ana- grams . The first of these words
is called the root of the multigram. For instance, the word
bbabab is a multigram with the root bba because it consists of
anagrams bba and bab.

Help Pero solve the riddle by determining whether his word is a 
multigram and determining its root in case it is. If there are multiple 
possible roots of the multigram, output the shortest.

Please note: Two words are mutually anagrams if one of them can be
obtained from the other by changing the letter order. 

Input:
The first and only line of input contains a word of length 
at most 100 000 lowercase English characters.
