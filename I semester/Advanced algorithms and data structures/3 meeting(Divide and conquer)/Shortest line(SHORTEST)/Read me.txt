Calculate length of shortest line, which ends are in provided set of points.

In:
Number n(2<=n<=1000000)
In next lines there are pairs of integer numbers x,y. (0<=x,y<=1000000000)
which are coordinates of each point. You can assume there won't be two the same points.
Out:
Length of shortest line with exactly 5 digits after the coma.

Example:
In:
5
0 2
5 7
2 0
5 4
6 6
Out:
1.41421
__________
In:
