Frank likes games and he has a new one in style of hopscotch.
You have numbers written down on each square from 0 to n-1,
where n is the number of squares. On every square there is only one number x.
Meaning that from this square you have to jump to square of number x. 
In the begging Frank is on the square number 0. Additionaly we know that by
following each square we always end up on the square number 0. Write a program that
will write down each number written on square that Frank is standing.

In:
Number n <1000.
N numbers of a_i. a_i is number on #i square.
Out:
Numbers b_1 ... b_k of each step of the cycle.(Respectively each square on which Frank is standing)

Example:
In:
8
3 5 1 6 4 7 0 2
Out:
0 3 6
