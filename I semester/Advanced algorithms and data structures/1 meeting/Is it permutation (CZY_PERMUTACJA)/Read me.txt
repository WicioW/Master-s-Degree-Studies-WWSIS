There is a string of numbers. 
Lets say this string is permutation if it has digits from 1 to n. 
Write a program that checks if provided string is permutation.

In:
In first line there is number n<=10^6.
In second line there are n numbers a_1,a_2, ... ,a_n. That 1<=a_i<=n.
Out:
Your program should write TAK(YES) if string is permutation and NIE(NO) if it is not.

Examples:
In:
3
1 3 2
Out:
TAK
______
In:
4
1 3 2 1
Out:
NIE
