All programs are written in C++.

Some programs in this folder may seem to be writen poorly(by today's standards)
or withoutnthinking about memory/time consumption. 
Some code lines may seem unnecessary too.
F.e. creating array of 2000 elements instead of user inserted number.
It is sometimes written this way only because Themis(online problem judge)
needs it(Themis is similar to SPOJ) to accept code and give points
for particular problem solution.
